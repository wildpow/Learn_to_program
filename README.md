# Learn_to_program
Exercises from the book Learn To Program by Chris Pine. I am going through this book for the Launch School's course 100 (	Programming & Back-end Prep).

April 7 - Finished chapter 2's exercises. The one about finding out how old you are in seconds is not 100% accurate yet. I still have not accounted for what month/day you where born or leap years but, still fun to put together. Also should go back and refactor my code at a later time. (really messy)
